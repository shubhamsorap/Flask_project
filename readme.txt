Task 1 
In first Task, I created Dataset(200,2) with two coulmns that are Hours slept and active.
Target Variable was Active column.
The task was to predict if a person is slept for these many hours then person will be active for how many hours.
After Preprocessing is done,i split the model using Train-test split where test size=0.2 ,the data was less so the more data we train the better it will predict on test. Then used Linear Regression for model building and for prediction.RMSE was 2.88 which means model prediction is good.

Next step to create webpage(input.html).Used Flask to link html and Regression model. 
after that I deployed the model on Heroku.com
